# note-taker
The contents of this repository are an Express Node.js application for taking notes. New notes can be added by entering a note title, note text, and then clicking the save button. Saving writes the note to a file for future use. Existing notes appear on the left hand side of the page. Clicking on an existing note will bring the full contents of the note up on the right side of the screen. Clicking the delete button will remove the note from the file database. The application is deployed on Heroku. See link below.
